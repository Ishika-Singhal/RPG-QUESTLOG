# ⚔️ QuestLog – A Gamified User Experience Platform

## 🧭 Overview
**QuestLog** is a collaborative project developed by our team — **Anuj Rawat** and **Ishika Singhal** — with the vision of merging productivity, gamification, and personalization.  
Users create profiles, embark on virtual “quests,” and level up their **avatars** based on real-world actions, progress, or achievements.

Our goal is to make every user’s journey interactive, rewarding, and fun — like living inside a game world 🌍.

## 🧠 Core Concept
At its heart, **QuestLog** transforms daily goals, learning progress, or project tasks into an RPG-style experience:
- **Users** register, log in, and manage their profile securely.  
- Each user owns an **Avatar** — representing their in-game identity.  
- Completing activities grants **XP (experience points)** and increases **levels**.  
- Avatars have **classes**, **stats**, and **gear** that evolve over time.  
- Future updates will include **quests**, **achievements**, and **leaderboards**.

- **Login:** Verifies credentials and returns a signed JWT for session management.
- **Token Auth:** JWT stores essential user info (email, username) for quick access.
